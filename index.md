## Better Minecraft

This resource pack is designed to keep Minecraft's textures the default, but make slight changes that perfect it. A better sun and moon, lower entity fire. A full list of changes can be found [on this page](changes). The pack is mostly 32x32, with Faithful being the placeholder resource pack. See all of the used resource packs on [this page](used-packs).

## Versions
> Using 1.8 on version 1.12.2 may work, but is not recommended. Downloading the different versions will guarantee all of the textures to be loaded properly.
